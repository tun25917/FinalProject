#Proposal
#The likely title would be simply 'Nathan's Homepage'

# My website outlines different things about me. Such as my favorite movies, hobbies, and my roommate's names

#My project will use different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

#My project will end up looking clean and simplistic. Including everything listed on line 4.

#I hope to be able to add more interactivity to my website.

#I will have to do my own research regarding HTML, CSS, and JS to achieve my goals.
